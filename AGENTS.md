## Agent Communication Patterns

### Sequential Workflow
```
Agent A → Agent B → Agent C → Result
```
Example: Ingest → Analyze → Rank

### Fan-out/Fan-in
```
       ┌→ Agent B →┐
Agent A┤            ├→ Agent D
       └→ Agent C →┘
```
Example: Listing → (Analysis + Commute) → Ranking

### Query/Response
```
Agent A ←→ Knowledge Graph Agent
```
Example: Compliance Agent queries FHA rules

### Feedback Loop
```
Agent A → Result → User → Feedback Agent → Agent A (updated)
```
